Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters it consists of, regardless of case.
    
    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
    3
    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
    4
    """
