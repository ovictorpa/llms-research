Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string, counting overlapping cases.
    
    >>> how_many_times('', 'a')
    0
    >>> how_many_times('aaa', 'a')
    3
    >>> how_many_times('aaaa', 'aa')
    3
    """
