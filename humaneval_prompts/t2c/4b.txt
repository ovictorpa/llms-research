Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset.
    
    Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) is the average absolute difference between each element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average |x - x_mean|
    
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """
