Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum elements found up to each point in the sequence.
    
    >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """
