Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    """
    Filter an input list of strings to include only those that start with the given prefix.
    
    >>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
    []
    >>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
    ['abc', 'array']
    """
