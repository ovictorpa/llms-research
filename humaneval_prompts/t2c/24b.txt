Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, which is smaller than n.
    
    >>> largest_divisor(15)
    5
    """
    # In case n is 1, the largest divisor smaller than n is 1
