Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

def change_base(x: int, base: int):
    """
    Change numerical base of input number x to base.
    Return string representation after the conversion. Base numbers are less than 10.

    >>> change_base(8, 3)
    '22'
    >>> change_base(8, 2)
    '1000'
    >>> change_base(7, 2)
    '111'
    """
    ret = ""
