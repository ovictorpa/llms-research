Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

from typing import List

def encode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Encodes the input string by cycling characters within each group of three.
    For each group of three characters, the function cycles the characters to the left.
    Groups with fewer than three characters remain unchanged.

    >>> encode_cyclic('abcdefg')
    'bca defg'
    >>> encode_cyclic('abcde')
    'bca de'
    """
def decode_cyclic(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Decodes a string that was encoded with the encode_cyclic function.
    Since encoding is a reversible operation, decoding is achieved by encoding the string twice.

    >>> decode_cyclic('bca defg')
    'abcdefg'
    >>> decode_cyclic('bca de')
    'abcde'
    """
