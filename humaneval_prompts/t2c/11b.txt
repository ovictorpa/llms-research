Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    """
    Perform a binary XOR operation on two strings consisting only of 1s and 0s.
    The result is returned as a string of 1s and 0s.
    
    >>> string_xor('010', '110')
    '100'
    """
