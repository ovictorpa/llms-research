Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Concatenate a list of strings into a single string.
    
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    """
