Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

from typing import List
import math

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Return a list of prime factors of the given integer in ascending order.
    Each factor is listed according to how many times it appears in the factorization.
    The input number should be equal to the product of all factors.
    
    >>> factorize(8)
    [2, 2, 2]
    >>> factorize(25)
    [5, 5]
    >>> factorize(70)
    [2, 5, 7]
    """
