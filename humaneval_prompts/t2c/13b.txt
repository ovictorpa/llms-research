Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Return the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers a and b using the Euclidean algorithm.
    
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
    1
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
    5
