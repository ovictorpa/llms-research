Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

def encrypt(s):
    """
    Create a function that takes a string `s` and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet rotated.
    The alphabet is rotated such that each letter shifts down by four places (2 multiplied by 2).

    Examples:
    >>> encrypt('hi')
    'lm'
    >>> encrypt('asdfghjkl')
    'ewhjklnop'
    >>> encrypt('gf')
    'kj'
    >>> encrypt('et')
    'ix'
    """
