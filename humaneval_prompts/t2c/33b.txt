Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

from typing import List

def sort_third(l: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    This function takes a list `l` and returns a list `l'` such that:
    - Elements at indices not divisible by three remain unchanged.
    - Elements at indices divisible by three are sorted in ascending order.

    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """
