Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

from typing import List

def sort_even(l: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    This function takes a list `l` and returns a list `l'` such that:
    - Elements at odd indices remain unchanged.
    - Elements at even indices are sorted in ascending order.

    >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
    [3, 6, 5, 4]
    """
