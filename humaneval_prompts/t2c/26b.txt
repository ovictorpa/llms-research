Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

from typing import List
import collections

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep the order of the elements left the same as in the input.
    
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """
