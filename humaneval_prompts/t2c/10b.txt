Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """
    Test if the given string is a palindrome.
    """

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """
    Find the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string.
    
    The algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string the reverse of the prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    
    >>> make_palindrome('')
    ''
    >>> make_palindrome('cat')
    'catac'
    >>> make_palindrome('cata')
    'catac'
    """
