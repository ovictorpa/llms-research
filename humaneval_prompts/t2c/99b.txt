Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

def closest_integer(value):
    """
    Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number and returns the closest integer to it.
    If the number is equidistant from two integers, round it away from zero.

    Examples:
    >>> closest_integer("10")
    10
    >>> closest_integer("15.3")
    15
    >>> closest_integer("14.5")
    15
    >>> closest_integer("-14.5")
    -15
