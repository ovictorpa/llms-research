Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

def is_happy(s):
    """
    Check if the string `s` is happy. A string is happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct.

    Examples:
    >>> is_happy("a")
    False
    >>> is_happy("aa")
    False
    >>> is_happy("abcd")
    True
    >>> is_happy("aabb")
    False
    >>> is_happy("adb")
    True
    >>> is_happy("xyy")
    False
    """
