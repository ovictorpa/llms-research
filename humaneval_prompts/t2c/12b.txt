Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Return the longest string from the list of strings.
    If there are multiple strings with the same maximum length, return the first one.
    Return None if the input list is empty.
    
    >>> longest([])
    None
    >>> longest(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'a'
    >>> longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc'])
    'ccc'
    """
