Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """
    Parse a string representing musical notes in a special ASCII format and return a list of integers
    corresponding to how many beats each note lasts.
    
    Legend:
    - 'o'  - whole note, lasts four beats
    - 'o|' - half note, lasts two beats
    - '.|' - quarter note, lasts one beat
    
    >>> parse_music('o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o')
