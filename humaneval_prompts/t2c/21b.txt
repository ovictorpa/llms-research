Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """
    Given a list of numbers (with at least two elements), apply a linear transformation to rescale the list 
    such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest number becomes 1.
    
    >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
    [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
    

    """
