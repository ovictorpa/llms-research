Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of the sum and the product of all the integers in the list.
    An empty sum should be equal to 0, and an empty product should be equal to 1.
    
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """
