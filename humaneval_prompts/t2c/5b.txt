Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:
    
def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimiter: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Insert a number 'delimiter' between every two consecutive elements of the input list `numbers`.
    
    >>> intersperse([], 4)
    []
    >>> intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)
    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
    """
