Given the python function below and its description, create a unit test for it based on its operating instructions:

def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """
    Input to this function is a string representing multiple groups of nested parentheses separated by spaces.
    For each of the groups, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
    
    For example, (()()) has a maximum of two levels of nesting while ((())) has three.
    
    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
    [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """
